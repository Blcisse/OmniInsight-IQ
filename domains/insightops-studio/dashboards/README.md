# InsightOps Studio Dashboards

This folder will contain dashboard views tailored to commercial performance and engagement intelligence. Planned perspectives:

- **Executive views**: condensed KPI and trend snapshots for leadership review.
- **Analyst views**: deeper drill-downs with filters, comparisons, and anomaly context.

Only descriptive scaffolding is captured here; UI and data wiring will arrive in future phases.
This directory is reserved for frontend dashboard routes, UI components, and visualization configs that present InsightOps Studio intelligence.

Scope for future steps:
- KPI cards, charts, and tables tailored to commercial performance and engagement.
- Executive and operational view configurations.
- Clear separation from existing health/wellness dashboards.
