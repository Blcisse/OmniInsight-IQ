# InsightOps Studio AI

AI work in InsightOps Studio remains documentation-only until the deterministic analytics layer is stable. This folder now
owns the prompt/response contract notes that previously lived under `ai_contracts/`.

Current emphasis:

- **Summarization-first**: narrative outputs derived from known metrics and analytics.
- **Prompt contracts**: schemas and validation guidance for manager/board summaries.
- **RAG deferred**: retrieval augmentation is intentionally postponed; no vector or memory work before CD7.

No code ships here yet; implementation will follow after the analytics and data foundations solidify.
