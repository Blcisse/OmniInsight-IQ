# InsightOps Studio Analytics

This folder will house analytics stubs focused on commercial performance and engagement intelligence. Early analytic themes include:

- **Trends**: trajectory and momentum of KPIs over time.
- **Deltas**: period-over-period changes that highlight gains or regressions.
- **Anomalies**: simple detection of unusual movements that warrant a closer look.

These are descriptive placeholders; implementation logic will be added in later Core Dev phases.
