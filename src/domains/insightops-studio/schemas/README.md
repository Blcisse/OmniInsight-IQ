# InsightOps Studio Schemas

This folder will host domain-isolated schema definitions for InsightOps Studio. Draft entities include:

- **KPI entities**: commercial performance indicators, targets, and goal tracking.
- **Engagement entities**: signals around recruiter or client interactions and touchpoints.
- **Summary entities**: structured summaries that capture narrative insights for reports and dashboards.

No implementation code is present yet; these notes serve as scaffolding for upcoming schema design.
