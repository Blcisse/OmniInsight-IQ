# InsightOps Studio AI

This folder will document AI contracts and flows for the domain. Current emphasis:

- **Summarization-first**: narrative outputs derived from known metrics and analytics.
- **RAG deferred**: retrieval augmentation is intentionally postponed; no vector or memory work in CD1.

Content is descriptive only; implementation will follow once foundational analytics and schemas are in place.
